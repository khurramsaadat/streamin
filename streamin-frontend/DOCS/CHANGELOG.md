### Feature Enhancements & Filtering
- Added cast details, IMDb scores, and interactive filtering (by cast, genre, country, production company) on the Movie Details page using TMDBâ€™s `vote_average` for ratings.
- Made filter fields clickable, routing to `/movies` with query parameters.
- Movies page now reads query parameters and fetches filtered results, displaying a sticky filter badge with a clear button.

### UI/UX Improvements
- IMDb badge styled as a yellow pill, right-aligned; runtime as a gray pill below every MovieCard.
- Standardized MovieCard component for consistent use across the site.

### TypeScript, Linter, and Build Issues
- Removed unused props/imports, updated usages, and fixed linter/type errors.
- Guided installation of TypeScript, ran type checks, and ensured the project was error-free.
- Addressed Netlify build errors, especially around SidebarProps and prop passing.

### Codebase Organization & Best Practices
- Created a shared `Genre` type in `src/types.ts`, updated all relevant components to use it.
- Audited and updated SidebarProps interface for accuracy and maintainability.
- Added JSDoc/type comments for clarity.

### UI Consistency & Sidebar Improvements
- Sidebar now uses a modal with checkboxes for filtering.
- Selecting a genre/country routes to a new `/browse` page with combined results for both movies and TV shows.
- Created `/browse` page supporting combined filtering, pagination, and sticky filter badges with a "Clear All" option.
- Grid layout updated to show 10 cards per row on all main pages, with responsive design.

### Visual Tweaks
- Header and sidebar backgrounds made visually distinct from main content.
- Sidebar link hover color unified with the "Terms of service" link.
- Sidebar width and link font size reduced for a more compact look.
- Removed duplicate "AI flix" text in the sidebar, keeping only the header logo.
- Logo changed to a modern text-based "AI flix" logo.

### Card and Poster Improvements
- MovieCard updated to use `object-contain` and a 2:3 aspect ratio to prevent poster cropping.
- Grid adjusted for 10 cards per row, card size reduced for a tighter fit.
- Only meaningful badges (not "N/A") are shown on cards.

### Loading Experience
- Skeleton loaders (animated gray blocks) added to all main pages to replace the popcorn placeholder during data loading.
- Error handling and debug logging added to all main pages, with clear error messages and console logs for API responses and errors.

### Search Functionality
- Search bar now passes the `search` state to Home, Movies, and TV Shows pages.
- On Home, search bar filters both movies and TV shows; on Movies/TV Shows pages, it filters only that type.
- Search bar background made visually distinct from the header.

### Final State
- The app is now modern, responsive, and user-friendly, with robust filtering, search, and error handling.
- All TypeScript and linter errors were systematically addressed.
- The UI and codebase were iteratively refined for best practices and maintainability.
